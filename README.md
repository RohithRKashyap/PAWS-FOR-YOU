# PAWS-FOR-YOU
Our project is Paws For You, which is a pet adoption website, developed for those who are really in need of a pet. But instead of buying one, you can just adopt one with minimum adoption charges. Pets 
are brought to you with all the care right where you live. 
You can also look for what and which kind of pet you need in our ‘know your type’ section to get more educated about all the different breeds.
The ‘adoption list’ is where you can look at all the pets you’ve marked as ‘interested’, where you can remove or update the list.
‘Become a patreon’ is that section where you can volunteer or appreciate our work in the form of donations.
